# vonty

The **goals** of the package vonty are as listed below:
1. mdm
2. dd

In order to achieve those goals, vonty comes along with the following **features**:
1. Minimalist UI
2. Tied to LaTeX

vonty uses django, not because it's a web framework, but because it's proficient as a database manager.
